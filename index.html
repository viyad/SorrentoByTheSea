		<h1>Company information</h1>
		<p>On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.</p>
		<p>Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.</p>
		<p>Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden.</p>
		<p>A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.</p>
		<p>Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy!  An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.</p>
		<p>This is the perfect place for a home away from home.</p>

		<h1>Testimonials</h1>
		<p><q>So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time&excl;</q></p>
		<p><q>This apartment is close to everything. We didn&apos;t need the car as the walks were amazing</q></p>
		<p><q>Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in&excl;</q></p>
		<p><q>Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt.  Thank you.</q></p>
		<p><q>What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it and will return again and again.</q></p>
		<p><q>Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever&excl;</q></p>
		<p><q>A few minutes&apos; walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can&apos;t think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne&excl;</q></p>
		<p><q>Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever&excl;</q></p>
